# BlueJam

## KNOB Attack

With KNOB your Bluetooth speakers can be monitored for iPhone and Android use. The first way you can do this is to step up the KNOB attack. The second is to let the KNOB attack decrypt or weaken Bluetooth traffic between the two devices. By doing this, you will have an opportunity to get the session over.
